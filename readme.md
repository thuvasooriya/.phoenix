# phoenix
**nix** setup to be reborn again and again anywhere and everywhere.

Apart from the sexy name, this config is nowhere near useable. I'm currently testing it on my macbook with apple silicon and some of my cute little linux machines which are also aarch64. So I don't think this is the phoe**nix** that I want it to be yet, but I mean... when is a child ever what you want to be. (cringe intended)

## Current Goals
- siphon the whole ghostty terminal setup on macOS to be reproducible
- using homebrew nix module to switch all opensource apps to be reproducible
- setup universal nvchad config w/ wo/ nixvim
- porting my starship and fish goodies to nix

## Looking Forward
- balancing nix-darwin and home-manager to give maximum reusability between linux and macOS
- learn nix stuff
- error handling
- stability pinning
- encryption and securities automation
- below 5 line setup for generic linux and nixOS
- system-manager for generic linux
- installer prepare steps defining

## Done
- basic fish and starship setup
