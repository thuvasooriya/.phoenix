# sooriya's neovim config

this config uses nvchad mainly to organize and get nice themes by default and improves upon it by introducing new features utilizing plugins that I deem necessary.
This is still under progress and still have much work to do :)

Let's goooo

## to do
- project and session management maintaining tabs
- build tasks and test tasks easy implementation
- remapping J and K to faster movement
- figuring out glitches in filetree open and close

## long term goals
- platformio setup
- ghostty integration
- moving to neovim 10

### memo
- use :qa to quit to terminal easily closing all buffers
- K is mapped to LSP highlight
- <leader>gg to get lazygit
- <leader>fp to navigate projects
